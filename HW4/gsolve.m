function [g,lE]=gsolve(Z,B,l)

% Given a set of pixel values observed for several pixels in several
% images with different exposure times, this function returns the
% imaging system�s response function g as well as the log film irradiance
% values for the observed pixels.
%
% Assumes:
%
%  Zmin = 0
%  Zmax = 255
%
% Arguments:
%
%  Z(i,j) is the pixel values of pixel location number i in image j
%  B(j)   is the log delta t, or log shutter speed, for image j
%  l      is lamdba, the constant that determines the amount of smoothness
% 
% Returns:
%
%  g(z)   is the log exposure corresponding to pixel value z
%  lE(i)  is the log film irradiance at pixel location i

%  w(z)   is the weighting function value for pixel value z
% 	  here we set w(z) to a constant
